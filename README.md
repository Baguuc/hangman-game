# Hangman game (Terminal)

The goal of this game is to guess a word letter by letter.
If a letter is not included in the hidden word, it will be saved to "Wrong chars" section and the left attempt count will decrement.
If a letter is included in the word, it will be added to "Correct chars" section and positions of this letter in the word will be shown instead of "_" (underscores) in the indicator at the top.

The only possible characters the words can consist of and that can be guesses are alphabet letters.
